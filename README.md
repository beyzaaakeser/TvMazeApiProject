<h1>My TVMaze API Platform</h1>

Thanks to the TVMaze API, I am here on the movie platform, where I dynamically shoot updated movie information. Thanks to the layout created with Bootstrap, the site has an aesthetic and functional structure. The project includes features such as dynamic loading of movie posters, responsive design, and detailed movie information display. Posters, names, and genres of the movies appear on the main screen. By clicking on any movie, users are directed to its detail page. The detail page includes comprehensive details about the chosen film, including the title, language, nation, review, summary, cast, and score. When users navigate the website, they can easily and quickly search for the movie they want and get movie details based on their search terms.
